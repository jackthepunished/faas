// Thin in-package wrapper around pkg/audit.Auditor that bakes in the
// "apid" actor constant and the auditOps interface.
//
// The pkg/audit package is the canonical best-effort AppendEvent
// wrapper (ADR-035); apid and schedd both use it. This file exists so
// the existing `s.audit.Emit(...)` callsites in handlers don't churn
// across the cross-daemon lift — the shape stays exactly the same,
// only the underlying implementation moved to pkg/audit.
//
// Lift rationale: pkg/audit/audit.go holds the single best-effort
// wrapper (ADR-035). Lifting lets schedd reuse it for cron.fired
// without duplicating the failure contract. The apid wrapper keeps
// the auditActor const baked in so the 10+ emit sites added in
// PR #349 stay unchanged.
//
// Issue #286 added a second emit path, EmitFailedLogin, that goes
// through a buffered channel drained by a single background goroutine.
// ADR-035 explicitly rejected a synchronous INSERT on every failed
// login as a DoS amplifier under credential-stuffing; the async
// flusher is the seal that closes that gap. The downstream emit
// path is the same state.Store.AppendEvent call used by Emit — no
// new SQL surface, no new migration.
