// Sampler goroutine for the <prefix>_top_tenant_rps gauge (issue #300).
//
// Layering:
//
//   observeWrap → ObserveTopTenantRPS(id)   — per-request bump of the
//                                              rolling-window count.
//   topNSampler.run                         — once-per-5s tick that
//                                              computes rps from the
//                                              diff and calls
//                                              EmitTopTenantRPS.
//   EmitTopTenantRPS                        — drives the gauge from
//                                              the topAccountSet
//                                              snapshot, bounded at
//                                              cap+1 series.
//
// Why a goroutine:
//
//   The top-N read is the single goroutine that should ever drive the
//   gauge. If the per-request path (observeWrap) called Set on the
//   gauge directly, the cardinality bound would depend on the
//   instantaneous top-N membership, which bounces under concurrent
//   sampling — the gauge would accumulate one series per id that ever
//   transiently held a top-N slot, blowing past cap+1. Pushing the
//   gauge write to a once-per-5s tick from this sampler keeps the
//   gauge series set bounded at cap+1 deterministically.
//
// Why 5s:
//
//   Matches the spec §12 dashboard's 5s poll rate and the 24h rolling
//   window's natural sample grid. Faster (1s) burns CPU on the sort
//   for no panel fidelity gain; slower (30s) lets a noisy customer
//   skip through the gauge between ticks.
//
// Why a 24h rolling reset (not lifetime, not daily-snapshot):
//
//   The acceptance contract (issue #300 #4) is "top-1000 by 24h
//   request count". A lifetime view would let a one-shot noisy
//   customer persist in the top-N forever; a daily-snapshot view
//   would let a quiet customer jump into the top-N at midnight
//   UTC regardless of activity. The 24h rolling reset strikes the
//   balance — the dashboard reads "today's noisiest customers".
//
// Lifecycle:
//
//   Started by cmd/apid/main.go's bgBefore hook after the server is
//   constructed; runs until ctx is cancelled. Stops cleanly because
//   the only mutable state is the topAccountSet (the gauge rows
//   persist across ticks — Prometheus gauges don't have rows to
//   delete; emitting 0 simply updates the existing series).
