// MFA gate (IAM-2, issue #186).
//
// requireMFA is the session-cookie-side companion to requireScope.
// It runs after s.auth has stamped the verified principal, and
// reads the mfa-pending flag off the session envelope via a
// separate context value (pkg/auth/middleware.WithMFAPending). The
// flag is true when the cookie was issued by a login path for an
// account with a confirmed authenticator or an explicit
// mfa_required policy; the cookie-stamp path in
// pkg/auth.RequireSession (the cookie branch) is the only writer.
// ADR-046.
//
// The MFA allowlist is path-prefixed against r.URL.Path in
// pkg/auth/middleware so the dashboard's /v1/account whoami can
// render the "MFA required" prompt without itself being gated.
// Every other session-cookie route 403s CodeMFARequired. API keys
// bypass the gate (MFAPendingFrom returns false/ok=false → key
// path bypass) per the IAM-2 design decision in the plan.
//
// Pre-PR-1 this file held the cookie-stamp helpers
// (withMFAPending, mfaPendingFrom, mfaAllowlist, isMFAAllowlisted)
// and the s.requireMFA method body. After pkg/auth lifted the
// cookie branch + RequireMFA into the new package, both moved
// with it — keeping a copy here would have been an unused
// duplicate golangci-lint flags as dead code. The s.requireMFA
// facade now lives in cmd/apid/auth_facade.go. This file keeps
// only mfaSessionPending, which the login handlers use to decide
// whether to stamp MfaPending=true on a freshly issued cookie.

// mfaSessionPending is the predicate the login handlers check to

// explicit policy hook for future operator/workspace enforcement;
// it also keeps already-armed legacy accounts fail-closed until they
// enroll or an operator clears that policy.

// Used by handlers_auth_*.go and the OAuth callbacks. Kept as a

// can call it inline without exposing the predicate outside
