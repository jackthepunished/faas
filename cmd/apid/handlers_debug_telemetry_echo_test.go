// handlers_debug_telemetry_echo_test.go — round-trip tests for
// echoDebugSince. The previous bug was that handlers echoed
// sinceDur.String() which Go formats as "120h0m0s" — parseable
// in Go, but customer automation that consumes the response and
// feeds it back into a follow-up request breaks because tooling
// expects the short "Nd" / "Nh" canonical form. These tests
// lock in:
//  1. raw parseable input is echoed verbatim (round-trip safe)
//  2. empty raw falls through to canonical form of effective
//  3. clamped effective duration renders the canonical Nd / Nh
//     form so the customer can detect the discrepancy
//  4. unparseable raw falls through to canonical form of effective
//
// Part of PR-B's /code-review review-fix cluster.
