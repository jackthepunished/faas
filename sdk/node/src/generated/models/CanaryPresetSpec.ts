 * The canary ladder a customer asks for on a deploy (issue

 * Stream F). Preset is the catalog name from
 * pkg/api/canary (none/slow/balanced/aggressive/1-10-50-100/
 * custom). When Preset is 'custom', Stages is the
 * customer-supplied ladder (each entry is percent +
 * duration string in time.ParseDuration form, e.g.
 * "1% at 30s, 10% at 2m, 100% at 0s").
 * The wire-format change (StepDurations removed, Stages
 * added) is additive on the consumer side because the
 * prior StepDurations field was declared-but-dead — no
 * pre-PR client ever sent it.
