   * Read-only preview of what a deploy would change.
   * PR-1 of the deploy-diff cluster. Server-side equivalent of
   * `gregale deploy --diff` — runs the same engine (pkg/deploydiff)
   * and returns the same wire shape (DiffResponse).
   *
   * Read-only: no DB writes, no audit row, no deployment row. The
   * app-not-found case is 200 with `diff.changes[]` containing a
   * `would_create_app` row + the quota gate firing against the
   * customer's plan — a CI consumer can preview a fresh deploy the
   * same way the CLI does.
   *
   * Auth: bearer-key with `apps:read` (or admin). NO MFA on this
   * endpoint, mirroring GET /v1/apps/{slug}/metrics.
   *
   * Schema-break detection is text-only in PR-1 (handler / entrypoint
   * / env-key changes → warn-severity Breaks). Structural OpenAPI
   * response-schema diff lands in PR-2.
   *
   * @returns DiffResponse DiffResponse with `blocking: true` if any break has
   * `severity: "error"`. CI gate input — `jq '.blocking'`
   * collapses to a single bool.
   *
   * @throws ApiError
