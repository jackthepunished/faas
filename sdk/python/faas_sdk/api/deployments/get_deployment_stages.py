     Returns the closed 6-stage summary for a deployment. Companion
    to `/v1/deployments/{id}/logs` (which streams `event: stage`

    returns the typed deployment row). This endpoint serves the

    `snapshot_prepare` / `readiness`) is enforced at the

    `current` field is the stage the deploy is in right now;
    `history` lists the closed rows in transition order
    (oldest → newest), each carrying server-measured
    `duration_ms` so the CLI / dashboard don't have to trust
    a 2s-tick reconstruction.

    A 404 is returned when:
