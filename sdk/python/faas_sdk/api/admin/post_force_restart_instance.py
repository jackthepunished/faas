    r"""Enqueue a force-restart intent for a wedged RUNNING instance (admin-only).

     Operator-side recovery primitive for instances wedged in
    {RUNNING} that the customer can't wait for the idle
    reaper to handle AND whose snapshot is suspected to be
    the carrier of the wedge. Composes the two earlier
    primitives: kill the instance (force-park) AND flip the
    deployment's latest warm + init snapshots stale
    (force-cold-boot). Per ADR-005 (\"snapshot of a wedged
    VM is a wedged VM\"), the recovery action is destroy +
    snap-stale so the next Wake is a guaranteed cold boot.

    PR #1105 (P2d follow-on to PR #1099): apid writes a row
    to `operator_intents` (kind = `force_restart`, CHECK
    widened by migrations/00446) and emits
    `pg_notify('operator_intent', …)`; schedd (the ONLY
    writer to `instances` per CLAUDE.md §6.2) is the sole
    consumer and dispatches via `engine.ForceRestart` so the
    `pkg/state/machine.go` `CanTransition` guard fires on the
    locked re-read. The handler returns 202 Accepted with an
    intent_id; the operator polls
    GET /v1/admin/operator-intents/{id} for terminal state
    and `snap_ids_marked_stale`.

    Gate is intentionally TIGHTER than force-park's
    ({RUNNING, WAKING, COLD_BOOTING}): force-restart only
    acts on RUNNING instances because the engine's
    state-machine validation at pkg/sched/engine.go:5299
    rejects non-RUNNING states as
    `state.ErrInstanceNotRunning` (a wedged WAKING /
    COLD_BOOTING instance's nodeID may be empty or its
    destroy path may race with the Wake). Operators targeting
    WAKING / COLD_BOOTING instances get 409
    `instance_not_restartable` with no intent row written.

    `?confirm=true` is required as a tripwire against
    operator fat-fingering. Optional `?reason=<slug>` defaults
    to `operator_force_restart`; values are clamped to the
