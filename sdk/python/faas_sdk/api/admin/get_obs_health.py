     Operator-side meta-observation endpoint. Composes a single
    JSON snapshot from:

      - `audit_log_write_total[5m]` / `audit_log_write_failures_total[5m]` /
        `audit_log_coverage_ratio_5m` — apid's own Prometheus

      - `SELECT kind, count(*) FROM operator_intents WHERE
        status = 'running' AND started_at < now() - interval
        '5 minutes' GROUP BY kind` — single SQL query.
      - `SELECT kind, count(*) FILTER (WHERE trace_id IS NOT
        NULL)::float / count(*) FROM events WHERE kind LIKE
        'operator.action.%' AND at > now() - interval '5
        minutes' GROUP BY kind` — reads events (live), NOT
        audit_log (FK-free post-deletion copy).
      - `count(ALERTS{alertstate=\"firing\"})` — Prometheus
        Alertmanager integration.

    Federation is out of scope (each daemon owns its own
    /metrics); this endpoint is the local apid's view. Kinds
    with zero rows in the SQL-derived fields are seeded to
    0 (counts) or 1.0 (ratios, vacuous truth) so the JSON
    shape stays stable.
