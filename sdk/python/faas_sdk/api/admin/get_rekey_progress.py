    r"""Read the cumulative rekey walk progress (admin-only).

     Returns the latest RekeyProgress snapshot the apid rekey
    runner has written — either to the in-process atomic pointer
    (memory-only mode) or to FAAS_REKEY_PROGRESS_FILE on disk.
    Operators poll this endpoint to monitor the walk after a
    host identity rotation; the response shape mirrors
    rekey.RekeyProgress exactly so a future operator tool
    (e.g. `gregale rekey status`) can decode without a parallel
    type.

    `total` is the running count of rows observed so far; it can
    grow as the walk paginates through (account_id, app_id, key)
    order. `rekeyed` + `skipped` should approach `total` once
    the walk drains. `failed` should stay at zero; a non-zero
    value means the unseal step threw for at least one row —
    the operationally safe recovery is `git rm
    migrations/*reserve_slot.sql`-style idempotent re-trigger
    (toggle FAAS_REKEY_ENABLED and restart apid; the seen-set
    inside Replayer dedupes already-done rows).

    When the runner is disabled (FAAS_REKEY_ENABLED unset), the
    endpoint returns 503 with code `rekey_disabled` so an
    operator can distinguish \"no work yet\" from \"feature off\".

    Raises:
        errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
