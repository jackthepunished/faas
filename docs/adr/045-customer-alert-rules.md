# ADR-045 — Customer-configurable alert rules (issue #396)

Status: accepted on the ADOPT branch (issue #396 closure).
Deciders: platform owner; reviewed under issue #396.

## Context

Customers today can be alerted about **money** but not about
**breakage**. The existing customer-alerting surfaces cover spend
(#263 spend alerts, #262 quota warnings, #264 MTD projection).
Operator alerting (#275, #278) watches the platform, not the
customer's app. The web console's Alerts page today simply states no
rules can be configured.

The data dependency that blocked this is now closed: #273 shipped
`GET /v1/apps/{slug}/metrics` over a closed `range` vocabulary, and
`/v1/invocations` carries terminal state + `last_error` for cron /
queue / delayed-task runs. What's missing is the rule store, the
evaluator, and delivery.

## Decision

### Delivery channel

Webhook only. Email is deferred behind #246, which is the
sustained-outage ticket for the mail transport (today a fresh deploy
defaults to `LogSender` and silently drops mail, and no caller
retries on `mail.ErrTransient`). Criterion 5 of #396 says "email …
or webhook" — webhook alone satisfies it. A second channel can land
once the mail path is hardened.

### Evaluator location

meterd. Added as a sixth loop modelled on the quota tick. meterd
gains Prometheus reach (`FAAS_PROMETHEUS_URL`); today meterd has
zero outbound HTTP. The shared PromQL builders live in a new
`pkg/appmetrics` so the apid metrics endpoint and the alert
evaluator can't drift.

### Condition model

Two-source, both constrained to the same closed window vocabulary
(`5m,15m,1h,6h,24h,7d,15d` from the metrics endpoint, defined in
migration `00023`):

| `metric`            | Source        | Evaluator path                  |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| `error_rate_pct`    | Prometheus    | `pkg/appmetrics` PromQL         |
| `latency_p50_ms`    | Prometheus    | `pkg/appmetrics` PromQL         |
| `latency_p95_ms`    | Prometheus    | `pkg/appmetrics` PromQL         |
| `latency_p99_ms`    | Prometheus    | `pkg/appmetrics` PromQL         |
| `cold_start_pct`    | Prometheus    | `pkg/appmetrics` PromQL         |
| `request_count`     | Prometheus    | `pkg/appmetrics` PromQL         |
| `failed_invocations`| Postgres      | `CountFailedInvocationsSince`   |

The closed vocabulary is what satisfies criterion 3: the evaluator
cannot ask Prometheus for data outside `prom_retention_days:15`,
because the window itself cannot be set to anything else.

### Account-scoping + nullable `app_id`

Rules are account-scoped on the FK root. `app_id` is NULLABLE on
purpose: NULL means **account-wide**. The CHECK constraint
`alert_rules_failure_source_xor_chk` ties `failure_source` to
`metric='failed_invocations'` so an account-wide rule still pins a
single source dimension when its metric demands one.

### Cool-down (criterion 4)

Two complementary primitives:

1. **State transition** — a rule only fires on `ok → firing`.
   Subsequent breaching ticks do nothing. `firing → ok` happens on a
   healthy evaluation.
2. **Idempotency-key UNIQUE on `alert_deliveries`** — even across a
   flapping `ok → firing → ok → firing` cycle, the
   `idempotency_key` (rule_id + ':' + floor(epoch/cooldown_seconds))
   bucket suppresses a second delivery inside `cooldown_minutes`.

`ClaimAlertFire` is the atomic compare-and-advance primitive. It
mirrors `LoadAndStampLastQuotaWarning` (the CTE captures the OLD
stamp *before* the UPDATE; a naive `returning col = $2` is trivially
true post-update and was the regression CI caught in PR #69 — see
`pkg-state-usage-monthly-tz-compare.md`).

### Degraded-source rule (criterion 7)

Never fire when the metric source is degraded. Zeroed fields on a
degraded read would make `error_rate_pct < 5` trivially true and
fire every "below threshold" rule on the fleet. The gate is a single
string-prefix check (`Source` starts with `"degraded: "`); the
evaluator increments `meterd_alert_skipped_degraded_total` and moves
on.

### SSRF defence

Customer-supplied webhook URLs are reused through `pkg/oci/egress.go`.
It already denies RFC1918, CGN, loopback, link-local (IMDS), ULA,
multicast, and explicitly closes the DNS-rebinding hole by refusing
both hostnames that *resolve* into a denied range and direct IPs in
a denied range. The check runs **twice**: at rule-create validation
(fast 400 with `code: alert_webhook_denied`) and again at dial time
via the `EgressDialContext` transport hook, because DNS can change
in between.

### Secret handling

`webhook_secret` is write-only. Sealed with `secretbox.SealOne`
(age/X25519, existing host key — NOT a new env KEK). Reads return a
masked constant. Never logged (§11). Re-sealing is part of the
`PATCH` surface as an optional pointer field; a `nil` skips the
reseal.

### Scope reuse

Reuse `ScopesReadSurface` / `ScopesDeployWriteSurface` rather than
adding `alerts:read` / `alerts:write`. Scopes are an API-key
back-compat surface; crons set the precedent.

### Limits

`AlertRuleLimitPerApp` / `AlertRuleLimitPerAccount` sit beside the
cron limits in `pkg/api/limits.go`. Fail-closed accessors. Per-plan
defaults: Free **0/0** (gated to 402), Hobby 3/10, Pro 10/30, Scale
25/100.

### Console (criterion 9)

The production console is the separate `faas-frontend` repo (PR #160
deleted `website/`); a tracking issue is filed there. The in-repo Go
dashboard page (`pkg/dashboard/templates/app_alerts.html`) ships in
PR 4 as the operator-visible artifact.

## Consequences

- **PR split**: four PRs (PR 1 stores, PR 2 metrics+webhook lib,
  PR 3 API surface, PR 4 evaluator+console+e2e). The four together
  close #396; the latter three cannot land without PR 1.
- **meterd gains an outbound HTTP dependency** (Prometheus + webhook
  delivery). Operators who run meterd without network egress for
  these paths are out of scope — the metadata URL is a new
  deployment-time knob.
- **Cross-app `failed_invocations` queries** now happen every
  `FAAS_ALERT_INTERVAL` (default 60s). The `invocations_app_pending_idx`
  partial index serves most of them; the cross-app aggregate scan is
  the worst case for a noisy customer and lives only on the
  per-tick sweep.
- **CWE-918 (SSRF) avoided in three layers**: validator fast-fails
  obvious cases, the OCI dialer double-checks DNS at dial time, and
  the meterd retry loop always re-dials against the freshest DNS
  answer.

## Follow-ups (not this ADR)

- #246 — wire real mail transport + retry; then add email as a
  second channel.
- `faas-frontend` issue for the console Alerts page.
- `POST /v1/alert-rules/{id}/test` — synthetic delivery for
  first-time setup.
