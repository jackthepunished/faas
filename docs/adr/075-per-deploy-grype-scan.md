# ADR-075 — Per-deploy grype scan surface (issue #464)

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Issue:** #464
- **Depends on:** issue #299 (base-ext4 factory scan), ADR-038 (build
  attestation umbrella)
- **Supersedes:** nothing
- **Superseded by:** nothing — closes issue #464

## TL;DR

Surface — don't enforce. The per-deploy grype scan runs against
the per-app layer ext4 in imaged's deploy-complete hook and lands
the result on the `deployments` row (one column: `scan_result`
jsonb, plus two status columns: `scan_status` ∈ {pending, complete,
failed, skipped}, and `scanned_at`). The surface is read on
`GET /v1/deployments/{id}`, `GET /v1/deployments/{id}/scan`, the
dashboard deploy detail page, and `gregale deployment <id> --show-scan`.
CRITICAL-CVE images deploy successfully (AC #4) — the scan is
async, post-deploy, and never reverses the live flip.

## Context

`pkg/imaged/grype.go` runs at build time (issue #299) and writes
a fail-closed `CRITICAL=9999` sidecar to the storage backend keyed
by `wire.ScanKeyForBaseKey(baseKey)` — that's a **base-ext4
factory scan** used by vmmd's `bringUpScanCheck` to refuse boot of
an un-scanned base. The **per-deploy scan** that issue #464 wants
is a different surface: it runs over the app-layer squashfs *after*
the layers-above-base diff, and the result lands on the
`deployments` row so the customer (and the dashboard) can see what
CVEs are in the image they just deployed.

The two concerns are parallel verticals (cosign/sbom vs grype CVE);
co-locating them in ADR-038 would conflate them. This ADR is the
home for the per-deploy scan surface.

## Decisions

1. **Surface, not enforce.** Per-deploy scan failures **stamp**
   `scan_status='failed'` on the row; they never reject the deploy
   (AC #4). The 5-min SLA (AC #1) is observed but not gated on —
   the dashboard's "scan overdue" chip is the only consequence.

2. **Async dispatch.** The scan runs in imaged's deploy-complete
   hook, AFTER `SetDeploymentRootfs` and BEFORE the snapshotting
   transition. The deploy row flips to `live` first; the scan
   lands within Grype's per-layer ~1-3s plus the 30s retry backoff.
   ~5-30s p99 per deploy, well under the 5-min SLA.

3. **One-retry-backoff policy.** A grype runner error triggers one
   retry after 30s; persistent failure flips `scan_status='failed'`
   with the last error in the JSON `error` field. Continuous
   re-scanning is **out of scope** (the issue's scope is
   surface-the-result, not continuous-monitoring).

4. **Closed-enum `scan_status`.** `pending | complete | failed | skipped`
   (NOT a boolean), CHECK-constrained at the schema level. The
   pre-feature backfill stamps `skipped` on every pre-#464 row so
   the dashboard's "scan pending" chip never sticks on legacy
   rows.

5. **apid-only-writer to customer-intent tables.** Apid is the
   sole writer of the `scan_result` / `scan_status` / `scanned_at`
   columns. Imaged reaches the column via `state.Store.UpsertDeploymentScanResult`
   which the apid wiring owns (PR-3). The "who writes" rule is a
   daemon-coordination rule at the pg_notify boundary, not a
   Go-package boundary — same precedent as SetDeploymentRootfs.

6. **No new cross-component abstraction.** The seam is the
   existing `state.Store` interface — no `ScanResultSink` in
   `pkg/imaged` (cluster's design proposed one; the final form
   dropped it because imaged already imports `pkg/state` for
   the deploy-status update). One fewer indirection.

7. **Read-side surface:** four reads, one store column.
   - `GET /v1/deployments/{id}` — additive `scan` field on the
     response (decode jsonb, repin status from the authoritative
     column).
   - `GET /v1/deployments/{id}/scan` — full drill-down
     (counts + CVE list). 404 on `scan_status IS NULL`, 200 with
     `{status: "failed", error: "..."}` on `scan_status='failed'`.
   - Dashboard `/dashboard/apps/{slug}/deployments/{id}` — server-rendered
     full scan view.
   - `gregale deployment <id> --show-scan` — CLI flag, not a new
     subcommand (the `gregale scan` name is already taken by the
     Phase 3 repo-decomposition dry-run).

8. **Local types in pkg/dashboard.** pkg/dashboard defines
   `ScanPayload` / `SeverityBucket` / `VulnerabilityRow` locally
   rather than importing `pkg/api.ScanResult` — same
   package-isolation rule that drove `AppListItem` vs `pkg/api.App`.
   The handler at `cmd/apid/handlers_dashboard.go` is the only
   thing that crosses the api → dashboard boundary.

9. **Metrics.** Three new wire metrics, mirroring the issue #299
   imageScanVulns precedent:
   - `_deploy_scan_duration_seconds{app}` histogram with an
     explicit 300s SLO bucket.
   - `_deploy_scan_total{app, result}` counter labelled
     `complete|failed|skipped`.
   - `_deploy_scan_vulns_total{app, severity}` counter labelled
     the Grype closed set.
   - All three are safe on a nil receiver (the wire package's
     nil-safe receiver convention).

10. **tests/ pins.** Two unit tests pin the seam — not the SQL:
    - `pkg/imaged/scan_test.go::TestRunDeployScan_StampsComplete`
      — happy path round-trip.
    - `pkg/imaged/scan_test.go::TestRunDeployScan_StampsFailed`
      — grype failure stamps `scan_status='failed'` with the
      error preserved; the deploy's lifecycle status is untouched.
    - `cmd/e2e/scan_e2e_test.go` (PR-7) — boots apid + imaged +
      fakeregistry, walks the full path, plus the cross-account
      404 isolation test.

## What this ADR does NOT do

- Does NOT make wake depend on a scan landing (AC #4 forbids).
- Does NOT continuous-rescan (single scan per deploy).
- Does NOT export CVE findings to a separate table — the row
  carries the full payload in `scan_result` jsonb.
- Does NOT move the base-ext4 factory scan (issue #299) — the
  two stay parallel.

## Verification

- `go test ./pkg/imaged/... ./pkg/wire/...`
- `go test ./cmd/apid/... ./pkg/dashboard/...`
- `go test ./cmd/gregale/...`
- `make lint && make test` (the standard 4-gate sweep)
- `go test ./cmd/e2e/... -run TestE2E_Scan` (PR-7)

## Validation experiments

- V-1 (replay): PR-3 commit 1 contains the pre-fix output for
  the `state.Store.UpsertDeploymentScanResult` seam that the
  test 1+2 above now pin against.

## Subsequent amendments

### Top-10 dashboard cap (commit on issue #464 PR-B extension)

The dashboard's deployment detail page now renders the **top 10
CVEs by severity** with a "View full scan (JSON)" link to
`GET /v1/deployments/{id}/scan` when the scan had more findings
than the dashboard width allows — per the AC #3 text
("dashboard deploy detail page shows severity counts and the top
10 CVEs by severity, with a link to the full list"). The cap is
at the **handler edge** (`cmd/apid/handlers_dashboard.go::
dashboardScanPayload`) — the wire DTO, the `/scan` route, the
SDK, and the gregale `--show-scan` CLI flag keep the **full**
list, so customers reaching the API directly don't have to
reimplement the cap. Sort is stable on severity ordinal
(CRITICAL=0 → UNKNOWN=4, anything outside the enum sorts last)
then on ID for ties. The handler populates a new
`dashboard.ScanPayload.TotalCount` so the template can render
the "Showing N of M" copy + the link. The cap value
(`dashboardScanTopN = 10`) is a top-level const at the handler
edge so a unit test in `handlers_dashboard_test.go::
TestDashboardScanPayload_TopNCap` can iterate without
copy-paste; the test pins overflow (15 → cap to 10), the
no-cap-when-under-N path, zero-finding, and nil-scan.

### `Vulnerability.Paths` populated from `artifact.locations[].path`
(commit on issue #464 PR-B extension)

The wire `Vulnerability` DTO now carries `paths []string`
(grype's `artifact.locations[].path`); the issue's example JSON
explicitly cited this field. PR #651 dropped `Paths` from the
wire in `b9f44593 fix(scan): drop unused Vulnerability.Paths`
on review finding #54 ("customers don't need internal grype
match paths"); the PR-B extension reversed that stance when the
dashboard's "Path" column was added so customers can identify
which shared library to rebuild. `pkg/imaged/grype.go::
parseGrypeOutput` (extracted from `runGrypeImpl` so unit
tests don't need a grype subprocess) decodes the new fields
and emits a `pkg/imaged.Vulnerability` slice on
`ScanResult.Vulnerabilities` (omitempty, so zero-finding scans
stay compact). The base-ext4 sidecar continues to read only
`SeverityCounts`; the new fields flow through ScanResult and
are written to the deployment row, never to the sidecar. The
SDK regen (`make sdk-gen`) mirrors the new field on
`sdk/node/Vulnerability.ts` and `sdk/python/
faas_sdk/models/vulnerability.py`; sdk-go is hand-curated. Open
follow-up: persist all of `vulnerability.fix.versions[]` as a
slice if a CVE ever carries multiple fixed versions (grype
currently emits one fixed-version string per CVE).
