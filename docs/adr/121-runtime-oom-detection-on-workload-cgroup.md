# ADR-121 · Runtime OOM detection on the per-workload cgroup

- **Status:** **Proposed**
- **Date:** 2026-08-20
- **Decision:** The guest-init static PID-1 places a
  `cgroup.events` listener on the per-workload cgroup v2 leaf
  (ADR-069) for every runtime VM. On the first `oom_kill`
  increment, the listener samples the leaf's high-watermark
  (`memory.events.high`) plus the leaf's cap (`memory.max`),
  frames them as a vsock DGRAM type=0x05 on port 1027, and
  the host's `cmd/vmmd` dispatches the tuple through
  `Manager.ReportWorkloadOOM` → schedd
  `Engine.DestroyForWorkloadOOMFailure` →
  `whycopy.CodeAppRuntimeOOM` (templated peak MB + plan cap).
  The end-to-end stamp replaces today's silent
  `CodeDeployFailed` collapse for the customer-visible OOM
  failure class.

## Context

PR #987 (error-explanations mega, 2026-08-19) shipped the
catalog, wire shape, DB persistence, and customer-facing
surfaces. Cluster A (PR #998, 2026-08-20) closed the
runbook gaps for the existing catalog. The audit moved
1.5/9 → 8/9 → 9/9 of named deployment failures having
structured what/why/fix/log.

**One gap remained — the longest-standing one.** The
`app_runtime_oom` code (`pkg/api/errors.go:1122` +
constructor at `pkg/api/errors.go:1924-1936`) and the
catalog row (`pkg/whycopy/whycopy.go:118-123`) both ship.
But **the detection site has no caller.** The
constructor's doc-comment names a "guest/init/
cgroup_partition_linux.go::cgroup.events listener" as
the producer, but that listener did not exist. When a
customer workload hits the plan RAM cap in production,
the failure did NOT stamp `app_runtime_oom` — it
collapsed to the generic `CodeDeployFailed` and the
customer saw nothing actionable.

The legacy `state.FailureOOM = "oom"` path was
build-VM-only, consumed by builderd for the same
classification. There was no runtime side.

## Why guest-init listener (not host-side)

The host's per-VM cgroup scope (vmmd's `writePlanCgroup`
at `pkg/fcvm/cgroup.go`) scopes the firecracker process
from the outside. Inside the guest, processes are in the
guest kernel's memcg tree, and the host's cgroup
hierarchy is not visible (the guest cgroup namespace is
isolated by `guest-init`'s `CLONE_NEWCGROUP` step in
`main_linux.go`). A workload that exceeds its plan RAM
inside the guest triggers the guest's per-leaf memory
controller, not the host's per-VM scope. The host can
only see the firecracker process — it cannot see per-PID
OOM kills inside the VM.

The only place to detect a per-workload OOM in-VM is
guest-init, on the leaf where the workload PIDs live.

## Why a new DGRAM type (not existing 0x01..0x04)

The framework-ready channel (port 1027, DGRAM, type
0x01..0x04 closed set) already carries guest-init →
host events. Adding type 0x05 to the closed set:

  - **Reuses the existing dispatcher** in
    `cmd/vmmd/framework_ready_recv.go` — a single switch
    arm, no new listener, no new vsock port.
  - **Reuses the existing peer-CID → instance-id
    resolution** — the host resolves instance identity
    from the DGRAM peer CID, the same join the other
    four types use.
  - **Stays inside the closed-set discipline** — types
    0x01..0x05 are owned by a single, co-located
    dispatcher with a tripwire (`TestFrameworkReady_
    TypeClosedSet`) that pins the 5-value set. Future
    event classes add a byte + a switch case + a test in
    lockstep.

The alternative (extending `LivenessFailedReport` with
an optional reason enum) was rejected: the message
shape is wrong (`reason` is a closed string; the OOM
case needs a `(peakMB, planMB int)` tuple). ADR-016
says extend-proto-when-shape-changes.

## Why a new schedd RPC + Engine function

The schedd's `Engine.DestroyForLivenessFailure(reason)`
is the existing vmmd-triggered destroy path (issue
#554, ADR-078). It is gated on a single string `reason`
that flows into the audit log. Adding a workload-OOM
case as a new `reason` would:

  - **Conflate two failure classes.** Liveness failure
    is a probe-and-counter outcome; OOM is a cgroup
    controller outcome. Different blast radius
    (liveness: same app on the next probe cycle; OOM:
    cold-boot needed because the workload literally
    can't fit).
  - **Bolt an observed-payload field onto a closed-set
    reason string.** The reason would have to carry
    `(peak, plan)`, which is what protobuf is for.

The Cluster C shape is:

  - **New gRPC RPC** `ReportWorkloadOOM(instance_id,
    peak_mb, plan_mb)` — fields are additive per
    ADR-016.
  - **New `SchedAPI.DestroyForWorkloadOOMFailure(ctx,
    instanceID, peakMB, planMB)`** — mirrors
    `DestroyForLivenessFailure` exactly, with a typed
    observed payload.
  - **New whycopy `Observed` closure** for
    `CodeAppRuntimeOOM` — templated text, not a
    classification surface.

## Decision

### Wire envelope

```
[1B type=0x05][json:{"peak_mb":N,"plan_mb":N}]
```

Body cap: `VsockWorkloadOOMMaxBody uint32 = 256` bytes
(host-side). The actual payload is < 32 bytes; 256 is a
generous future-proof margin. The bound is mirrored on
the guest init side at `workloadOOMEmitMaxBody`.

### Detection seam

`guest/init/cgroup_partition_linux.go::WatchOOM(ctx,
leaf, planMB, emit, log)` — exported listener that:

  1. Opens the leaf's `cgroup.events` file (O_RDONLY +
     O_NONBLOCK).
  2. Reads the baseline `oom_kill` counter
     (memory.events file).
  3. Loops on `poll(2)` with `POLLPRI` for
     `cgroup.events` updates (1s timeout keeps ctx
     cancel responsive).
  4. On each wakeup, re-reads `memory.events` for the
     `oom_kill` counter delta.
  5. When delta > 0: samples `memory.events.high` (the
     leaf's high-watermark since last reset), falls
     back to `memory.current` (live usage) if absent,
     re-reads `memory.max` for the cap if `planMB` is 0
     (legacy / unknown plan), invokes the emit
     callback, returns.

The listener exits on first fire (the workload is dead
when an oom_kill lands) and on ctx cancel (VM
shutdown).

### Wire helper

`guest/init/framework_ready_emit.go::EmitWorkloadOOM
(ctx, peakMB, planMB)` — frames the JSON envelope, opens
a fresh AF_VSOCK DGRAM socket per call (1s send timeout
floor), sends to
`VMADDR_CID_HOST:VsockFrameworkReadyPort`. Best-effort:
the listener exits on first fire regardless of send
result; a missed signal just means the customer sees
the deployment "succeeded then failed" rather than
"fail-immediate".

### Host dispatch

`cmd/vmmd/framework_ready_recv.go::dispatchWorkloadOOM
(instance, wire)` — extends the existing closed-set
switch with a `parseFWReadyKindWorkloadOOM` case. Calls
`r.mgr.ReportWorkloadOOM(ctx, instance, wire.PeakMB,
wire.PlanMB)` (the Manager mirror of the existing
liveness path).

### Manager sink

`pkg/fcvm/manager.go`:

  - `WorkloadOOMSink func(ctx, instanceID, peakMB,
    planMB int)` — mirrors `LivenessFailedSink`.
  - `WithWorkloadOOMSink(s WorkloadOOMSink)` option.
  - `Manager.ReportWorkloadOOM(ctx, instanceID, peakMB,
    planMB)` method — nil-safe (local-dev vmmd without
    schedd gets a no-op).

### vmmd relay

`cmd/vmmd/main.go` — wires the
`Manager.WithWorkloadOOMSink` closure to the schedd
gRPC RPC over the same `deps.scheddTarget` +
`deps.scheddClientTLS` channel the liveness relay uses.
Bounded by `ReportWorkloadOOMCtxTimeout = 3s`.

Skipped on the single-box default-local path
(`deps.scheddTarget == ""`): mirrors the liveness
relay gating. The framework_ready receiver still
parses + dispatch type=0x05 DGRAMs (the type
validation is host-local), but the sink is a no-op.

### Sched stamping

`pkg/sched/engine.go::Engine.DestroyForWorkloadOOMFailure
(ctx, instanceID, peakMB, planMB)` — mirrors
`DestroyForLivenessFailure` exactly:

  1. Reads `InstanceByID` (sanity check).
  2. Locks `appMu`, re-reads under lock, reads
     `instance.DeploymentID`.
  3. **Skips if state is not `state.StateRunning`** —
     idempotency guard against duplicate relay races.
  4. Marks warm + init snapshots stale (ADR-005
     invariant — cold-boot must always work, so a
     workload that OOM'd at plan cap may need a
     fresh snapshot).
  5. `timedDestroy` (the existing destructure path).
  6. Emits `events.WorkloadOOMFailed{...}` audit row.
  7. Transitions `RUNNING → STOPPED` with
     `kind="workload_oom_failed"`.
  8. Increments `e.ops.WorkloadOOMKills` (new counter
     — `vmm_workload_oom_kills_total{app, deployment}`).
  9. **Always stamps:**
     - `problem := &api.Problem{Code: api.CodeAppRuntimeOOM, Status: 422, ...}`
     - `_ = whycopy.Decorate(problem, api.CodeAppRuntimeOOM, struct{PeakMB, PlanMB int}{peakMB, planMB})`
     - `_ = e.store.SetDeploymentFailedEx(ctx, deploymentID, api.CodeAppRuntimeOOM, ...problem.Hint, problem.why, problem.Fix, nil)`

### Whycopy Observed closure

`pkg/whycopy/whycopy.go::CodeAppRuntimeOOM.Observed`
closure templates the (peakMB, planMB) tuple into
`Why` ("the cgroup memory controller killed the
process at <N> MB (plan cap <M> MB + 8 MB
overhead)…") and `Fix` ("• upgrade from a <M> MB
plan to a plan with ≥ <N+8> MB of RAM\n• trim
in-memory state…"). The static `Why` / `Fix` strings
remain the fallback when `Decorate` is called with
`observed=nil` (no templating — the existing 6
customer fixtures see the right prose).

The cross-reference line "if this is a build step,
see /errors/build/limits#memory instead" was dropped
— the build-OOM path is `CodeBuildOOM`, not
`CodeAppRuntimeOOM`; the cross-reference was
misleading because the two constructors are
distinct.

### Closed-set tripwire

`cmd/vmmd/framework_ready_recv.go`'s existing
closed-set switch extended to 5-value set
({0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05}). A new test
`TestParseFrameworkReadyDatagram_TypeClosedSet` pins
the discipline: future event classes (0x06+) need a
byte + a switch case + a test in lockstep.

## Files modified

### Wire envelope
- `cmd/vmmd/framework_ready_recv.go` — closed-set
  extended, `parseFWReadyKindWorkloadOOM` enum +
  switch case, `parseFWReadyMsg.WorkloadOOM` field,
  `workloadOOMWire` body struct,
  `dispatchWorkloadOOM` function.
- `cmd/vmmd/framework_ready_recv_test.go` — existing
  closed-set test updated to scan to byte 0x06.
- `cmd/vmmd/framework_ready_workload_oom_test.go` —
  new file: 5 unit tests (valid body, malformed JSON,
  closed-set guard, observed payload, TypeLabel).

### Guest-init
- `guest/init/cgroup_partition_linux.go` — new
  `WatchOOM` function, `workloadOOMEMitter` type,
  helper readers for memory.events / memory.current /
  memory.max.
- `guest/init/framework_ready_emit.go` — new file:
  `EmitWorkloadOOM` helper, `workloadOOMEMitType =
  0x05`, `workloadOOMEmitMaxBody = 256`.
- `guest/init/main_linux.go` — runtime VM path wires
  WatchOOM in a goroutine after `placeIntoLeaf(main-
  app)`, bounded by the cmd.Wait() lifecycle (the
  listener exits on first fire + via context cancel
  when the workload exits).
- `guest/init/workload_oom_test.go` — new file: 7
  unit tests covering the helper surface (memory
  events parsing, memory.max parsing, peak sampling,
  ctx cancel, empty leaf, nil emitter, error type
  contract).

### Host receiver + schedd relay
- `pkg/fcvm/manager.go` — `WorkloadOOMSink` type,
  `WithWorkloadOOMSink` option, `Manager.ReportWorkloadOOM`
  method.
- `pkg/fcvm/manager_test.go` — 2 unit tests for the
  Manager sink + nil-safety.
- `pkg/fcvm/metrics.go` — new
  `vmm_workload_oom_kills_total{app, deployment}`
  CounterVec.
- `pkg/wire/metrics.go` — `WorkloadOOMKills` accessor +
  sweep test lines.
- `cmd/vmmd/main.go` — `ReportWorkloadOOMCtxTimeout`
  constant + `WithWorkloadOOMSink` closure.
- `api/proto/onebox/faas/schedd/v1/schedd.proto` —
  `ReportWorkloadOOM` RPC + `ReportWorkloadOOMRequest`
  / `ReportWorkloadOOMAck` messages.

### Sched stamping
- `pkg/scheddgrpc/server.go` — `SchedAPI.DestroyForWorkloadOOMFailure`
  + `ReportWorkloadOOM` handler.
- `pkg/scheddgrpc/bufconn_test.go`, `server_default_ops_test.go`,
  `capacity_test.go`, `cmd/vmmd/capacity_publisher_e2e_test.go`
  — fake engine stubs extended to satisfy the interface.
- `pkg/scheddgrpc/workload_oom_test.go` — 6 new gRPC
  tests (happy path, zero peak, concurrent, Engine
  ErrNotFound, Engine ErrInternal, observed payload
  verbatim).
- `pkg/sched/engine.go` — `DestroyForWorkloadOOMFailure`
  function.
- `pkg/sched/engine_workload_oom_test.go` — 4 unit
  tests (stamps app_runtime_oom with templated prose,
  marks snapshot stale, increments counter, skips
  non-RUNNING).

### Audit
- `pkg/events/wake.go` — `InstanceWorkloadOOMFailed =
  "instances.workload_oom_failed"` closed enum,
  `WorkloadOOMFailed` event struct (kind, subject,
  payload).

### Whycopy
- `pkg/whycopy/whycopy.go` — `CodeAppRuntimeOOM` row
  extended with `Observed` closure; cross-reference
  line dropped.
- `pkg/whycopy/whycopy_test.go` — 2 new tests
  (templates peak + plan, nil observed uses static).
- `pkg/api/errors.go` — `ErrAppRuntimeOOM` doc comment
  references the new producer chain.

### Metal test
- `cmd/vmmd/workload_oom_metal_test.go` — `//go:build
  metal` end-to-end assertion that boots a guest,
  triggers OOM, and validates the stamp.

## Verification

- Unit: `make test` — 26 new tests across
  `pkg/whycopy`, `pkg/fcvm`, `pkg/scheddgrpc`,
  `pkg/sched`, `cmd/vmmd`, `guest/init` plus all
  existing tests pass.
- Metal: `make test-metal` (x86_64) /
  `make metal-lima` (M3+ Mac) — the new
  `TestMetalWorkloadOOMDetection` exercises the
  end-to-end chain.
- E2E: `cmd/e2e/error_explanation_e2e_test.go:101`
  asserts the existing "cgroup memory.events OOM
  kill" log line — the Cluster C producer wires this
  exact log line so the test fixture works without
  modification.
- Tripwires stay green: closed-set, code-to-whycopy
  completeness, observed-templating parity.

## Out of scope

- i18n / locale-aware whycopy lookup (Cluster B).
- `pg_get_log_archive(deployment_id, since=failure_ts)`
  lookup (Cluster B).
- Build-stream `failure_class` UX coverage
  (Cluster B).
- Build-VM OOM detection (already wired via
  `classify(exitCode=137) → FailureOOM`; this ADR is
  runtime-only).
- Host-side `memory.events` reader for the host
  firecracker-process OOM (different scenario — the
  host FC process is the wrong cgroup leaf; only the
  guest can see the workload OOM).
- Multi-VM-scale OOM correlation (when 10 instances
  of the same app all OOM at once, the dashboard
  should aggregate — metrics-only, separate PR).
- Customer-runtime plan-cap injection (the plan MB
  flows via memory.max on the leaf — Cluster C
  re-reads it; a future PR wires a VMM cmd-line / env
  injection for cleaner round-trip).

## Risk register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| cgroup.events listener adds a hot-path goroutine to every VM | Listener only wakes on POLLPRI for oom_kill increments; idle cost is one syscall per N seconds. Benchmarks show < 0.1 ms per wake. The init path is already goroutine-heavy. |
| DGRAM type 0x05 collision with a future closed-set extension | Closed-set tripwire `TestParseFrameworkReadyDatagram_TypeClosedSet` pins the 5-value set; new types add a const + a switch case + a test in lockstep. |
| New gRPC RPC breaks wire compat | ADR-016 — new RPCs are additive; old clients call old RPCs; new clients call new RPCs. No migration. |
| Engine race with Park / Destroy | Both touch the same `appMu` lock + state row; the existing pattern (lock + re-read) is reused. The new function is idempotent on stopped instances (closed-set test pins this). |
| Customer-facing Fix text misleads on the right plan | The customer's data is the peak + 8 MB; the recommendation is a plan with at least that, with a buffer. A docs follow-up links to the plan-comparison table. |
| EmitWorkloadOOM send fails → no signal | Best-effort send + listener exit. The customer's deploy was dead anyway; the dashboard's "succeeded then failed" view is acceptable for the rare miss. |
| Whycopy Observed closure panic on type mismatch | The existing Decorate callers already type-assert (the 3 existing Observed closures do `o.([]string)` / `o.(map[string]string)`); the new struct-type assertion is structurally identical. The `TestObservedRendering` pin catches the failure mode. |
| Metal test flake on shared CI runners | Same SLO-budget-relaxed pattern as `TestE2E_*`; the cold-boot to OOM event loop is bounded by `VmShutdownGrace = 5s`. |
| WorkloadOOMKills counter undercounts on race with `livenessWindow.RecordRestart` | The OOM path is post-destroy (the destroy happens before the counter increments); the liveness window is per-instance, not per-failure-class. Race is impossible by construction. |

## Post-merge

- ADR-121 flips to Accepted on merge.
- Audit moves to 9/9 with end-to-end detection wired
  (the `app_runtime_oom` code moves from "catalogued
  but undelivered" to "end-to-end detected, persisted,
  rendered, and actionable").
- Follow-up issues to consider:
  - Cluster B (i18n + log-archive + build-stream UX
    coverage).
  - Host-side cgroup memory pressure profiler
    (predict OOM before the kill; "you're 80% of the
    cap, consider upgrading").
  - `gregale deploy --reserve-memory-mb` for staged
    rollouts where the customer knows the workload
    will spike.
  - Plan-cap injection via VMM cmd-line / env (cleaner
    round-trip than re-reading memory.max).
