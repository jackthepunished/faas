// Package writegate implements the request classification + cross-box
// leader resolution helpers that the Tier A9 / ADR-084 standby
// write-redirect layer inserts in front of cmd/gatewayd-internal's
// existing apidProxy (cmd/gatewayd-internal/proxy.go).
//
// # Why this package exists
//
// ADR-083 (active-passive HA, PR #738) ships lex-min leader election
// + DNS handoff, but defers the customer-intent write path:
// standbys currently accept writes and route them to local apid,
// which writes to local Postgres — invisible to the leader and
// creating data divergence. ADR-084 closes the deferral.
//
// The redirect logic is **pure with respect to its inputs**: given
// the same `*http.Request` + the same `LeaderResolver.Current()`
// answer, the gate picks one of the documented outcomes. PR-A ships
// the classification helpers and the LeaderResolver interface;
// PR-B wires them into the proxy with the cross-box mTLS hop.
// This file holds **no state of its own** — every state transition
// (cache TTL, dial retry, pg_notify subscriber) lives in PR-B.
//
// # Boundaries
//
// The package MUST NOT import cmd/gatewayd-internal (the proxy is
// downstream of this gate) or pkg/state (the gate sees a
// LeaderResolver, not the raw store). It MAY import pkg/gateway/leader
// for the existing LeaderStore — but only as an interface
// satisfaction hint; the concrete store plumbing lives in PR-B.
//
// # Failure modes (enumerated, addressed by PR-B)
//
//   - Cross-box dial fails → 307 fallback (see package-level docs
//     in the parent plan file noble-swimming-balloon.md §"Terminology")
//   - Election returns no leader → 503 Retry-After: 60
//   - Cookie write on standby → 503 Retry-After: 5 (cookie cross-box
//     requires shared PG, deferred per ADR-025 Tier 2)
//   - Inbound X-Faas-Forwarded-Leader → 400 redirect_loop
//     (loop-storm DoS guard)
//   - mTLS handshake fails → 503 Retry-After: 5 with distinct log
//   - mTLS_failure metric
//
// All five map to a single WithLabelValues(outcome, authKind) call
// against pkg/wire's `<prefix>_write_redirect_total` counter.

//     the leader's HMAC verdict — both are strictly weaker than
//     the existing local verification.
//
//   - OAuth callbacks (/v1/auth/{google,github}/callback) bind
//     the OAuth `state` cookie to the box that started the flow.
//     Cross-box forwarding breaks the state binding.
//
//   - cli-auth paths (/v1/cli-auth/*, /cli-auth) are an anonymous
//     device-code flow where the customer machine polls for a
//     token. Redirecting mid-flow from standby → leader would
//     change the polling origin and break the device-code
//     semantics (the device code is per-host).

// `unauthenticatedCarveOuts` map AND in the test suite —
// promoting them to named constants (a) gives the protocol
// invariant a stable identity in logs/metrics, (b) prevents
// drift between the allowlist and the test fixture (goconst

// otherwise signal "this should be a constant"), and (c) lets
